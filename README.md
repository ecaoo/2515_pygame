# Project Details

Hello this is my first game I ever made! I hope you enjoy it. This is based off of the game Dino runner which is the game you can you play while your wifi is down.
This game is basically a reskin or remade of the original game but with my favourite video game character teemo! It a a runner style type of game where you run until
you collide with a teemo mushroom or a flying corki in the air. Try to run as long as possible and try to beat my highscore of 101!
